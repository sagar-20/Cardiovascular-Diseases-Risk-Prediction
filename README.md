# Cardiovascular-Diseases-Risk-Prediction
This study presents a detailed examination and modeling of a healthcare dataset with the primary aim of predicting various disease prognoses at the patient level 🎯. The dataset is characterized by a diverse set of features 📊 including age 📅, sex 👥, general health 💓, checkup 🏥, exercise 🏋️‍♀️, smoking history 🚬, and the presence of various diseases like heart disease, skin cancer, other cancer, diabetes, and arthritis 🦠.

Our exploratory data analysis highlighted significant differences in the distribution of various disease cases, illustrating the impact of various health and lifestyle factors on disease risk. We also encountered missing data in several features, emphasizing the necessity for effective missing data imputation methods 🕵️‍♀️ in healthcare prediction tasks.

We plan to leverage the power of machine learning, specifically gradient boosting algorithms like XGBOOST 🚀, to predict disease prognosis. The model will be rigorously trained and validated using a train-test split strategy 🔄, with the aim of delivering remarkable results on several performance metrics.

The disease predictions produced by the model will be evaluated using a confusion matrix, ROC curve, and Precision-Recall curve, providing a comprehensive view of the model's performance 📈. This approach highlights the importance of utilizing multiple evaluation metrics in imbalanced classification tasks ⏳.

This project underscores the potential of machine learning 🧠 in healthcare prediction tasks, providing insights that could aid in patient risk assessment 🗂️, healthcare planning 📝, and strategy formulation in clinical settings 💼. Future work could focus on refining the prediction model 🔍, exploring different strategies for class balancing 🧩, and integrating additional patient data 🔄 to enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of disease prognosis predictions 📈.
